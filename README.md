# SharkTV

A Flutter IPTV browser/player that fetches publicly available playlists (e.g., from [GitHub IPTV](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) and other sources) and presents channels in a clean, accessible UI.

## Features
- Browse channels in a simple, accessible interface grouped by countries

## Platforms
- Web (less reliable due to browser limitations) [here](https://lainmode.github.io/)
- Windows (most reliable) [(See releases tab)](https://github.com/Lainmode/SharkTV/releases)
- Untested on other platforms, but theoretically possible with minor modifications

## Build and Run
### Requirements

### Run

flutter pub get
flutter run
